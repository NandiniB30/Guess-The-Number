# Guess-The-Number
Instrutions - Have the user select a range. Let’s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer. Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses. If user guesses higher than the actual number, the system will show "Try Again! You guessed too high". If user guesses lower than the actual number, the system will show "Try Again! You guessed too small". If the user guessed in a 7 number of guesses, the user gets a “Congratulations!” Output. If the user didn’t guess the integer in the 7 number of guesses, user will get “Better Luck Next Time!” output.
